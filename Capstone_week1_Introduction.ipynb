        "However, in reality, the decisions on location are usually not done well-informed, with the limit of time and data. Besides, several important factors may not appear as apparent as others and can be easily neglected during the real selection process. Therefore, it is valuable to provide a data-driven recommdation for location pick to help business owners make a evidence-based decision."

        "Here, I will leverage the Foursquare API and other sources of data to depict a detailed profile of each neighborhood in Houston. Based on the profile data from other similar metropolitan cities, I will model this problem into a supervised learning model using most widely used classification models. The best prediction model will then be used to generate predictions on the neighborthoods in Houston about whether they are good choices for restaurant businesses. The whole process is driven by objective data and the final recommendation will therefore be completely data-driven. In more detail, I will also interpret the predicting model to generate the most important features for selecting the right neighborhood for the restaurant business, which can be used for future considerations."
