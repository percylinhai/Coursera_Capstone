        "We will use data from four cities: Houston, Los Angeles, Dallas, and NYC. All of them are big cities with variety, one in the north, the other three in the south. With these similarities, we hope to capture some core features that are critical to restaurant businesses, from which we can build a reliable prediction model. We will be primarily using venue category data from Foursquare API. The venue category data will be used as important features describing the neighborhoods. Besides, we will also include other features such as housing rate, foot traffic, demographics and so on."

For simplicity, we will use the percentage of total venues that are restaurant as the indicator. Here, we will set the cut-off value as 30%, meaning that if a neighborhood has more than 30% of venues being restaurant, we will say it is a good place to have a restaurant business and the label \"1\" will be assigned. Otherwise, label \"0\" will be assigned.\n",
